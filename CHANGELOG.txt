QtRadioNG changes log by Rick Schnicker KD0OSS
==================================================

2022/04/30   Up rev'd to version ALPHA 2.05
    Protocol 1 supports has been added to hpsdr.
    Added functions to send speaker audio to
    radio hardware. More bug fixes.

2022/02/13   Up rev'd to version ALPHA 2.04
    QtRadio now handles multiple panadapters.
    Configuration of panadapters after radio start
    still needs work.

    There is a receiver dropdown below the VFO
    that will select the active receiver/panadapter.
    Most menu and VFO commands will act only on
    selected receiver. Audio only on selected
    receiver.

    Rig control will work on Receiver 0. radio
    selected by adding radio index to TCP port #.

2022/01/29   Up rev'd to version ALPHA 2.03
    Change hpsdr code to manage most resources per
    reciever and transmitter slots.

    Continued changes to functions in dspserver to
    allow for control per virtual channel.

    Still cleaning up legacy code. Code still contains
    some unused variables and functions. Since the
    original code was designed to handle only one
    radio at a time my changes have left some of the
    source code a little ragged. This will take time
    to clean up.

    Changing QtRadio to handle multiple receivers.
    This means having multiple panadapters that can
    be added or removed as needed.

2022/01/08   Up rev'd to version ALPHA 2.02
    Put most DSP related functions into new source dsp.c
    to make it easier to use a differenct DSP core in
    the future.

    Added a few more WDSP function calls to dspserver.

    Cleaned up a few of the source files.

    HPSDR will now start up all the connected radio's
    resources upon connection rather than as needed.
    This simplifies client functions.

    Most all of the GUI widgets should function now.

    Bandscope function now works with receivers that
    allow it.

    Communication between user client and dspserver
    now managed on a channel structure. Each channel
    represents a specific IQ stream to and from
    each radio connected. A maximum of 35 channels is
    the current limit. The bottom 5 channels are
    reserved for bandscope streams. The maximum radios
    allowed to connect is 4. This is an abitrary number
    and may be increased in the furture.

    We currently allow upto 8 receivers and 1 transmitter
    per radio. The transmitter may be paired with any
    active receiver.

    More source file cleaning.
