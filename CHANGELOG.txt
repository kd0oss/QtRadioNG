QtRadioNG changes log by Rick Schnicker KD0OSS
==================================================

2022/01/08   Up rev'd to version ALPHA 2.02
    Put most DSP related functions into new source dsp.c
    to make it easier to use a differenct DSP core in
    the future.

    Added a few more WDSP function calls to dspserver.

    Cleaned up a few of the source files.

    HPSDR will now start up all the connected radio's
    resources upon connection rather than as needed.
    This simplifies client functions.

    Most all of the GUI widgets should function now.

    Bandscope function now works with receivers that
    allow it.

    Communication between user client and dspserver
    now managed on a channel structure. Each channel
    represents a specific IQ stream to and from
    each radio connected. A maximum of 35 channels is
    the current limit. The bottom 5 channels are
    reserved for bandscope streams. The maximum radios
    allowed to connect is 4. This is an abitrary number
    and may be increased in the furture.

    We currently allow upto 7 receivers and 1 transmitter
    per radio. The transmitter may be paired with any
    active receiver.

    More source file cleaning.
