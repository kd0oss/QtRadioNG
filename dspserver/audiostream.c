/**
 * @brief Client audio stream configuration.
 *
 * This structure is configured by the client to declare the audio
 * stream characteristics it wants to receive.  The configuration is
 * protected by audiostream_sem.  Each time an audio buffer is
 * allocated, the iq_thread consults this configuration and makes a
 * copy.  The audio stream configuration in iq_thread is then unchanged
 * until the buffer is disposed (by either passing it to the client, or
 * discarding it), at which point a new configuration is read.  This
 * prevents iq_thread from having to take the lock at each sample.
 *
 * If, at disposal, the audio stream configuration has changed since the
 * current buffer was allocated, the current buffer id discarded rather
 * than giving the client audio it does not expect. The default
 * configuration is for a buffer containing 50ms of audio, so this means
 * that audio stream configuration changes will cause 50ms of audio to
 * be lost.  If the client makes its buffers deeper or changes the
 * sample rate, this buffer may represent a longer or shorter period of
 * time.  If there is a desire to make it substantially longer, this
 * scheme will have to be reconsidered.
 *
 * The specific members of this structure are discussed in the
 * definition of struct audiostream_config.
